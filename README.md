biography, form of literature, commonly considered nonfictional, the subject of which is the life of an individual. One of the oldest forms of literary expression, it seeks to re-create in words the life of a human being—as understood from the historical or personal perspective of the author—by drawing upon all available evidence, including that retained in memory as well as written, oral, and pictorial material.

My names are Duncan imbenzi.I was born in the year 2008 march 8th in Nairobi county but kakamega as my home county.I am a Kenyan by nationalism.I was born by both two parents ,mum and dad who were not well enabled by that time but with time life could just move on.


In 2009,that's five years after birth,i started school at Mundulu primary school,i.e nursery school in Kakamega county.I had to take ten years in primary level having left in the year 2015 at standard eight with my Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education.

life in primary was just normal as i could not know where the world was heading ,i could see things normal,i could dream of more good carriers but then...that could not stop me becouse at the end ,i and my family too celebrated indeed becouse i emerged with not the best but good marks.

In 2011,i was lucky enough to join Shilalyo secondary school just also located in kakamega county.I could thank God becouse it was not easy,not easy as i say.I would use the simple resources available to make sure i sustain.I could meet friends there of different characters from different families with different ideas of life.some could narrate there story and i could see mine as AFADHALI.😭😭😭😭😭

The worst thing you should'nt do in life is to let your chosen chase dreams go,"never stand in a way to interfear with what should happen in its right time,"Wetangula's spoken words.

Lets just tuangalie maisha kwa jicho pevu tukijali;
